            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hello, this is Steven Glasford here. I am wanting to say thank you for coming
here and visiting my place where I can write anything I want.</p>
<p>I live in Minneapolis in the Loring Park area. I love it here, I’d recommend
everyone living there, there are places for any type, it is sort of weird.
But I moved to Minneapolis from Boston in 2022, oved to Boston in 2021,
moved to Fargo, ND in 2018, moved to Spearfish in 2012, moved to Minnesota
for the first time in 2003. So I have lived in mny places.</p>
<p>My favorite place so far is Minneapolis.</p>
<p>I started my hobby/dream of mine during the pandemic (at least something
nice happened). I first grew marijuana in my offie in Boston. Had to kill
it as I moved to Minneapolis. In Minneapolis I started growing other things.
I started trying to do high intensity vertical farming in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>In Boston I realized I didn’t need a car.</p>
<p>I will post to this blog ocassionally and I hope you enjoy it and would
suggest sharing with a friend.</p>
