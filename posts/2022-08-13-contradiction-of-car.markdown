title: Contradiction of Cars
---

I remember one time in my life that allowed my a vast amount of independence from not only my parents but from the entire world. At the time it didn't really hit me but my first bike allowed me to go literally anywhere. I could go to the beach, I could go to Walmart, I could go see my friends, I could get to school in less than about 4 minutes. I could go anywhere, the world was my oyster. 

I enjoyed the biking in Brainerd. There were plenty of leisure ways for me to cruise on my standard 10 mile runs. Everyday for one summer I pushed myself to ride at least 10 miles everyday. I felt healthy and I was being very healthy (though my diet was abysmal, though that is a post for a different time).

At the time though, I'd be stupid if I wasn't always reminded of the lack of a different mode of transportation, cars. I grew up in a proud and drive worthy family. My family had several cars, I think we had three at the time, though we only had two driving age people in the household. To my family, the car was a method of wealth generation.

I got my first license at 14, two years before the normative of 16 nationwide. My first car was a terribly ugly and fuel-inefficient Dodge Grand Caravan. It was silver. I never named it, but it soon became the sole method of my transportation life. I drove to school, yet lived less than a mile from school. I waited in the rush of traffic after school for about 15 minutes, before I had to drive 2 miles to get home (the biking and walking route was .8 miles). Everyday I choose to drive. When I got to pre-college (I was still in high school and still in South Dakota) and the college was .1 miles from my home and took 5 minutes to walk to. But I still drove.

For some reason I drove every single one of these days. I could have walked, I could have just as easily biked, but I never did. I started to weigh more, and this period I weighed 185, which I misintrepreted for muscle mass. But it wasn't I was just fat (I currently weigh 155, and am in a healthier BMI).

The van I took everyday eventually died, luckily though the van remains in the same landfill that it was trashed in. We had donated the van to some local organization for disabled adults which trained them to fix the cars. I saw the van a few more times on the road after we had donated it, but two years later I stopped seeing it. 

I eventually found it in a junk yard in Rapid City, without an engine, slashed tires and no head lights. The windows had been broken into and small shards of shatter resistant glass littered the ground nearest the car. The underbelly of the car was devoid of life, except for the lonesome centipeed, and the runs of winter mice which sought solice from the onslaught of foxes and owls which patroled the area at night and in the winter. 

I lost track of the van, but the last I saw of it the silver that made the van look darty in the winter and helped to keep it cool in the winter was replaced with a dirty rust, and the place where the van stood had rust stained grass and I could tell that the chemicals of the body had started to leach into the soil, mutating and stunting the growth of the grass that surrounded it. 

Eventually, I assume that the van was crushed and recycled, as the body (even if it was spalding and ruining the soil) still had value in the metals it contained. I hope, yet I will never know if that happened to the van as the junkyard simply grew until a sea of abandoned and unused cars filled the parking lot of death and forgottenness.

I had two more cars after that, a Pontiac Grand Prix, and a Lexus ES330. Both were terrible. I missed seeing my neighborhood (on a bike you are somewhat forced to remember the safest and most comfortable routes).
I missed going on trips and I became dependent on large expanses of empty and useless, barren, desolate, and sterile plots of land known as parking lots. I could no longer go down my favorite trails when I liked. I no longer felt the freedom I once felt as a child.

I spent too much repairing those other cars, I spent far too much on gas. I spent far too much of the lungs of myself, the lungs of my future children, and I killed far too many trees, birds, salamanders. I contributed to an economic system that over values and idolizes a material and chemical that is inherantly rare and finite. 

The truth is this car based lifestyle was stupid. I should have continued to ride my bike. I loved it, and because I loved it meant I should have continued to pursue it.
