title: Winter Ebike Manual (navigation)
---

I have been asked a bit too often lately how to winter bike.

First of all it is very easy, the coldest days are the easiest days to winter bike.

Winter biking and winter Ebiking are very similar, but winter ebiking is more convienent, a better car replacement, less tiresome, more comfortable, with the ability to go much further distances.

I started winter ebiking as a viable alternative to driving in the city of Minneapolis. With my ebike I am able to go to all places within the city in 15 minutes or less regardless of weather, with a more than 95% availablity rate. To put this in terms of driving, in the middle of winter during a blizzard the availabilty of driving is close to 40-60%, but for biking it is close to 95% still, with the only real obstacle being your battery and maintence of your bike.

Many people scoff at the idea of replacing their cars with an ebike as they often think the bike is either exhausting (because it is a bike), they need a lot of space for their children, they think it is slower than any other method travel, they think it is not safe, they think it is impossible to go to the store, but the reality is far from the truth as the ebike excels in each category better than a car, especially in the city.

Before starting your sexy winter biking conversion one must throw away all of the driving routes from one's mind as the number one rule for navigating by ebike: AVOID CARS. There is only one thing that is dangerous when ebiking, cars. Nothing else will kill you, you might slip in the winter, but only the cars will kill you. A car is the single most dangerous thing on the roadway. If you are coming from driving, DO NOT use the routes you are familar with.
How do you navigate? You must become familiar with the bike infrastructure around you. Oftentimes it is similar to using a bus route, but the bus is replaced with a bike trail.
Do not be fooled by bike lanes, if there are cars parked immediately to the side of the bike lane, and you are in America, assume the bike lanes are actually door opening buffers. DO NOT ride next to a car. What I often do is ride right on the bike lane line, this is often the safest way to prevent getting doored, and gives balance from shitty drivers who want to stay in their lane. Most of these shitty drivers come from the suburbs and are not aware of traffic laws requiring distance from bikers and pedistrains.

Finding the best routes often takes you through residential areas, and recreational areas. The quieter and more slow the traffic the better and safer. The best way to determine if a route is safe is to count the number of cars within about 7 feet of you. Technically the safe distance is 3 feet, but having a car that is 7 feet or more away feels extremely safe. 

For me in Minneapolis there are routes that satifies these criteria. And heat maps of people who bike on Strava is also a useful way to determine the safest areas to bike. 

Also try not to bike double breasted (side by side), it can get in the way of others, but it is easy to get in line.

Try not going super fast in heavy pedistrain zones, if you must go fast, blare music as loudly as possible, also have extremely bright lights. Most people are annoyed by bikers with a loud music maker, but it is very effective in getting people's attention. But please note that in the suburbs pedestrains often deaf, either they assume it is a car with music, or they are listening to music or something. 

If a person is not getting out of your way, reduce speed and go around them. You might scare them, but whatever, don't be rude to them, otherwise they might want to remove and restrict biking infrastructure in your community. 

Watch out for "bad" bike infrastructure, this is infrastructure that is improperly built and more for looks than anything else. The best example in Minneapolis is Hennepin Ave in Downtown. There is a bike trail that is built into the new street design, but it is often congested with pedistrains. 

The best Ebiking infrastructure that exists are tranistways. These were invented by the city of Minneapolis in the 1960s with the redesign of Nicollet Mall in Downtown Minneapolis. Transitways are the best infrastructure as they only have buses. Buses are incredibily safe and the drivers are extremely qualified and fantastic at their work. Please ensure the driver sees you before passing a bus, some transitways have buses going under 20 mph (such as Nicollet Mall), others are faster. 

I recommend using Open Street Maps when navigating as this often shows parallel streets to busy streets. If you must ride on a busy street, NEVER ride on the sidewalk. Ride in the middle of the lane (if you are not on a busy street), ride on the shoulder if available (please be careful of shrapnel that is constantly created by littering from cars, shrapnel will pop your tires). 

My bike has special solid tires, with a slime insert that allows for my bike to never get flat tires. I used to get flats often as I am a rough rider.

Please always be aware of others on the road, but you don't really need to be anymore aware than in a car.

Furthermore, routes change when winter arrives. This is due to different routes getting different attention. Minneapolis is one of the better cities in the world when it comes to winter maintence of the bike routes (it is probably top 5 in the world). Just remember that your summer route may change. The best example is from my home in Loring Park, Minneapolis to Lake Street cooridor. In the summertime I often take Bryant Ave S, but in the winter my route depends much more on 1st Ave South. This is due to the fantastic plowing effort on 1st Ave S that creates a new walled off snow trail. Bryant Ave however is too slow for plow trucks to properly maintain throwing speeds. This makes for a slower commute on the route. 

I will write more of these little manuals as I begin my transition to winter mode.
