title: The Future is the Metaverse
---

It feels weird that I sometimes have to walk back some comments I have had 
about the Metaverse in the past. But it is true, I used to think that the 
metaverse was the dumbest thing ever, but now I see it as the only real way to
grow as the future comes.

The economy is a really big thing. And for many years we have seen nothing but
growth and positivity from the markets. Our economy grows about 2.5% every
year (this is assuming the world won't end in the next couple of years and the 
world will become like the world before the pandemic) and this growth is 100%
absolutely critical to the functioning of our world, without this growth
people will starve, people will be unhoused, the heat won't turn on. Our
economy is absolutely 100% dependent on this growth to employ most people.

If you are a business and you want to make money you need to do one of two
things, make something, or provide a service. This service is a little weird,
but I refer a service to a something digital as well. 

The physical production of something creates something weird. If I sell
anything but seeds and raw food (this is like a farm selling something
without anypackaging), I produce some garbage. But everything is sold in
plastic now, and it is rather hard to find food and everything else one would
without any wastable product. Most of waste people generate is in the form of
plastice, at least mine is. At the end of the day, people generally will end up
throwing everything away. 

If I buy a rubics cube for example, that should then stay with me forever, as
it is plastic and will out live me by a thousand years. But everything will be
eventually replaced or broken or need to get replaced some how. 

But since the economy grows at 2.5% and there is only a few ways to grow
economically. The grow has to be either service or physical based. I assume the
physical economy grows at the same speed of 2.5%. This means that the amount
of garbage created will double every 28.07 years. This is gross.

Instead of growing our garbage I think people will be forced to go into the 
metaverse to generate more garbage, but at least the metaverse has unlimited
storage space.

So I personally think that the only place for the economy to grow in a post
garbage economy, is the metaverse, as we can make garbage there forever.

And I hope the metaverse is the future cuz it means that there won't be as
much real garbage and the birds can be heard again.
